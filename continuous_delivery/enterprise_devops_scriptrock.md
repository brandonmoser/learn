"Enterprise devops: not for the faint of heart"

These guys all agree that getting top-level buy-in is key. Especially in large orgs, grass-roots won't work
- especially in large orgs, there will be too much inertia to do this without top-level buyin

- especially if the goals of devops aren't actually aligned with the business's goals

- no matter how awesome your tech is, it won't mean much if teams aren't collaborating

- example: dev team chooses a config mgmt tool independent of ops buy-in

- however, in large orgs, the tactic is to start small, show successes, get stakeholder buyin, show it's not a threat
to the org or to people's jobs, that it's a better way of working together

- DevOps is not (just) automation!

  - if the dev team automates builds, and the ops team automates infrastructure, if those two things don't work together you haven't accomplished what you could have


- devops is principles and practices to leverage to get better, not just something you "do" or "attain"

- look to bottlenecks for areas to improve

- try to stop visualizing devops as an IT issue and describe it as an alternative model for the creation of business value

  - take a product-centric view
  - align IT resources in a way that promotes close collaboration for the goal of creating business value

- Identify and discuss crises, potential crises, or major opportunities

- form a guiding coalition; assemble a group with enough power to lead a change effort
  - encourage the group to work together as a team

- create a vision to help direct the change effort
  - develop strategies for achieving the vision

- communicate the vision
  - use every vehicle possible to communicate the new vision and strategies
  - teach new behaviors by example of the guiding coalition
  - describe "what's in it for me"; each group of people needs to understand

- empower others to act on the vision
  - getting rid of obstacles to change
  - encourage risk taking and nontraditional ideas, activities, and actions

- planning for and creating short-term wins
  - planning for visible performance improvements
  - recognize and reward employees involved in improvements

- consolidating improvements and producing still more change
  - change systems, structures, and policies that don't fit the vision
  - reinvigorate the process with new projects and themes
  - hire, promote, and develop employees who can implement the vision

- institutionalize new approaches
  - articulate the connections between the new behaviors and corporate success
  - setup systems to capture and share knowledge

!!!! make sure your motivations for devops are pure.
  - you want to get to 20 deploys a day? WHY?! What is the real value to the business
  - people can get behind the business value, not necessarily the tactic to get there


What isn't it?

  - it's not a branding of your dev and ops teams
  - it's not a new siloed team
  - "certainly not about going out there and imposing your view of the world"... you go out and read phoenix project and come back and say you're going to change all the things
     - again, make sure you're doing it for the right reasons
  - culture change is some of the hardest work that you're ever going to do
  - you have to prepare for a long-haul
  - it's not just all about tools, but for orgs that are so clueless and broken then tools can help kickstart process and culture change
  - this kind of change is all applications of the scientific method: create feedback loops; iterate; get better

  - "Devops is about 5 things: people, people, people, people, and people"
    - and tools can help those people, especially metrics tools that show what's working and what's not working


Where is enterprise devops heading over the next few years?

  - the horses, not the unicorns, are going to start doing this right

  - dev, ops, and product need to own the accountability of always-on services

  - just like with agile, there will come a time when "devops" is just how software delivery happens

  - should start integrating mroe teams, at the macro level: security, business, etc
    - at the micro level, there will always be conflicts


  - on that micro-level conflict:
    - devs want to ship more, ops want to keep the lights on... that is a friction
    - sometimes devs need to know when to back off, and ops needs to know when to lighten up (he didn't talk more on this)

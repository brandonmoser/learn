Gene Kim DevOps Meetup - July 23, 2013

Gene's 14 year journeyâ€¦ what he's learned by watching high performing organizations since 1999

# High Performers

Where did the high performers come from?
- Non-commissioned officers
- Chemical Engineer
- software auditing

Why?
- discipline and rigor

Visible Ops: Playbook of high performers

This is his journey into devops

# Act I: IT operations fixing fragile artifacts

- keeping services running on fragile infrastructure
- the tragedy of these fragile things is that they often underpin critical business operations / applications
- eventually the org becomes unable to meet the promises they make
- when we miss promises, we often compensate by making even bigger promises which we can't make

# Act 2: Developers

"show me a developer who isn't causing an outage and I'll show you one who's on vacation"

- urgent, date driven projects put into the queue, driven by deadlines / promises
- often leave no time for the downstream work centers:
  - security, deployment,QA
- resulting in one more fragile artifact in production
- deployments start taking longer


**Consequently: Ops and dev at war**

- goals aren't achieved
- Sev I incidents going up
- more firefighting

**Infosec**

- after this, nothing's left for them
- they're just making auditors happy, not helping the business
- deprived of the ability to control outcomes
- a demoralizing position for them to be in as humans and professionals

**learning: we should empathize with them**


This is the downward spiral

The IT Core Chronic Conflict
---------------------

Every IT org is pressured to simultaneously:
- respond more quickly to urgent business needs
- provide stable, secure, and predictable IT service
- "time to market will always trump availability and security"

Every Company is an IT company
- 95% of all capital projects have an IT component
- 50% of all capital spending is technology related
- Saying "IT is not a core competency" is a self delusion


When the gap between where we are and where we need to be is "IT", that's the problem

# Act 3: A Better Way

Previously, it was impossible to be fast and nimble and simultaneously reliable and secure
Points to 10 Deploys per Day at Flickr -- john allspaw and paul hammond, velocity 2009

**DevOps:**

- Ops who think like devs
  - How can we script environments?

- Devs who think like ops
  - As I'm developing, how do I ensure success, reliability, security, etc in production?
  - i.e. concerned about this software as a living thing out in the wild, not just as a feature that works on my machine
  - What must I do to ensure that my software isn't setting off pagers for ops people at 2AM?
    - What if **I** am the one on pager duty? 


High performers always accelerate away from the herd: "the best always get better"

High performing DevOps teams
----------------------------------------

More agile:
 - 30x more frequent deployments
 - 8000x faster cycle time than their peers

More reliable:
- 2x the change success rate
- 12x faster MTTR (mean time to recovery)


The Goal
=============

no book he recommends more
changed how a generation of people thought about plant operations

The Three Ways
=================
set of principles from which these devops are derived

## The First Way: Flow

- flow from dev to ops
- the left-to-right flow of work
- this is the flow through the value stream
- Understand the flow of work
- Always seek to increase flow
- Never consciously pass defects downstream
- never allow local optimization to cause global degradation
- Achieve profound understanding of the system

Questions:
What is your lead time for changes? (how long does it take to go from code committed to code successfully running in production?)


Root causes of failures:

- first time code was deployed in an environment like production
- this is the first time the code was married to its environment

Countermeasure: ops must be able to deliver environments on demand which mirror their ultimate deployment environment

- make sure devs build the code and environment at the same time
- create a common deployment environment

Change the Agile sprint policy:

"at the end of each sprint, we must have working code and the environment in which it runs"

What agile nailed was: "large batch sizes kill"

the goal is to shrink batch sizes

Deploy Smaller Changes, More Frequently

- decouple feature releases from code deployments
- Require all developers check code into trunk daily, at least
- practice deploying smaller changes, which dramatically reduces risk and improves MTTR

Facebook Chat story:
- they tested the chat service for a year, even though it was not live for users
- the browser would send fake chat messages to the server
- so by the time they deployed, they had a year of experience with chat
- They built the chat service in erlang, with which they had little experience, so this also gave them a year of experience with a new technology, even though users weren't using it for real

Breaking the Bottlenecks in the flow
---------------------------

- environment creation
- code deployment
- test setup and run
- overly tight architecture
- hard to have high deploy rates when things are so tightly coupled

How orgs achieve high performance
--------------------------
- 89% are using infrastructure version control
- 82% are using automated code deployments

The first way: outcomes
----------------
- creating single repos for code and environments
- determinism in the release process
- consistent dev, test, prod environments all properly built before deployment begins
- continuous delivery pipeline
- free ourselves from the learned behavior of catastrophic deployments
- decreased cycle time
- Fast release cadence

## The Second Way: Feedback

how do we take the learnings from the first way and feed it back into the system to prevent problems?

- understand and respond to the needs of all customers, internal and external
- according to lean thinking, the most important customer is the internal one---- the next downstream work center
- optimize for the person who receives our work
- shorten and amplify all feedback loops: stop the line when necessary
- It is better to stop production and swarm the problem than to allow the problem to flow downstream
- Continuous Integration / Delivery depends upon stopping the line!
- Create quality at the source
- create and embed knowledge where we need it

"shared pain helps significantly with the achievement of shared goals"

Google:
- devs initially maintain their own service
- any app must be self managed for 6 months before being eligible to be managed by Ops
- even at google, the SRE (site reliability engineers) are the scarcest talent they have
- so the worst thing they can do is squander their time with crappy apps
- Test whether developers qualify for IT operations resources
- Types / frequency of pager alerts	
- production hygiene
- defect counts and severity
- Ops has a "hand back" clause
  - after the handoff, if it's shitty, it goes back to dev for management
  - "You're not worthy"
  - Gene likens it to getting a puppy handed to you. "Sorry, it's peeing all over the floor. You take it back till it's more mature"


Etsy
-------
- monitoring all the things
- devs must ship with telemetry


Integrating into Continuous Delivery
-------------------------------------

- The days of reviewing request for change docs in change management meetings are over
- adding more approvals, and more processes, results in more failure because it decreases feedback
- failures should result in more automated tests in the CD pipeline


The Second Way: Outcomes
-------------------------

- defects and security issues get fixed faster
- standardized and reusable ops and infosec user stories now part of the agile process
- all groups communicating and coordinating better
- everybody is getting more work done


## The Third Way: continual experimentation and learning

Foster a culture that rewards:
- experimentation and learning from failure
- repetition is the prerequisite to mastery
- repetition changes habits; habits change outcomes

Why?
- you need a culture that keeps pushing into the danger zone
- and have the habits that enable you to survive in the danger zone

Break things early and often
- do painful things more frequently
- Developers thank you b/c they know it makes deploys go more smoothly


Break things before production
- enforce consistency in code, environments, and configurations
- Add asserts to find misconfigurations, enforce https, etc
  - If config isn't right, FAIL!
- add static code analysis to automated continuous integration and testing process
- twitter built a tool called "breakman"
- "the days of doing code scanning at the end of a project and getting back a 200 page PDF are over"


Marty Cagan, eBay
- devote at least 20% of time to paying down technical debt
- or else, you'll eventually end up spending a lot more time

Recognize compounding technical debt
things that keep getting worse



Scott Cook, Intuit
- During their peak season, they ran 165 experiments in production! 
- because that's when they had the people on their site so that the experiments could yield results
- on april 16, those experiments wouldn't have mattered


If Gene could wave a magic wand:
----------------------------

- become conversant with devops and recognize these practices when you see them
- be energized about how practitioners can contribute in this organizational journey

My question re: dev and security relationship

look on itrevolution and go watch "amazing twitter infosec talk"

### Other discussion points 

- Use application logs to demonstrate to developers the frequency of hack attempts on the sites
  - xss, sql injection, etc
  - helps us to avoid the "ghost" problem, where we're always fighting this specter of being attacked by enemies that are unknown to us
  - get concrete; get out of spooky "OMG if you guys only knew what we had to defend against but we can't tell you bc it's classified" mode


- The Patrick Lightbody story:
  - Once developers and not ops started becoming responsible for their app failures in production (i.e. on pager duty), quality started to improve. it's the "shared pain toward shared goals" thing.

- Gene mentioned 2 documents or guidance related to auditing... I need to email him for the names

- Ensure that security tests (authentication, xss, sql injection, etc) are part of the automated test suite

- Find things that you always do "at the end", and stop doing that!
  - Do these things early, and do them often

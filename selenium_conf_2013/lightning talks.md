"Flappers"
  - from salesforce dude from the morning

  how to detect?

    - failed tests get re-run


    - 'inferred flappers' - a test with fails/pass/fails/pass within a window is an inferred flapper

    - flappers go back to teh test owner, not the developer
      - important not to create noise for the developer
      - flappers are costly, so they work hard to avoid them

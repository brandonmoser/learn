# Continuous Automated Testing

## Challenges

  How do we test quickly enough to keep up

  Agile
   - we want new things and faster
   - we need information quickly
     - manual testing of new features and changes
     - regression testing is necessary
      - want regression tests to run as soon as the system is available

## Role of Automation

Initial automation

  - doing more work in same time period as developing features
  - benefits aren't immediate
  - probably build up a lot of tooling, etc
  - incurring more maintenance

  Then, finally, when tests fail, you have to figure out why they failed
    - did functionality change and test is broken?
    - environment config problem?
    - something else?

Most automated testing is regression testing

  - hard to test new functionality

At this point, I have no idea WTF this guy's point is

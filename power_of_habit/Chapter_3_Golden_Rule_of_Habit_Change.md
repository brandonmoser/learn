# Golden Rule of Habit Change

## Tony Dungy story
 - He transformed the Bucs by making their behaviors on the field automatic
 - He changed their habits such that they relied on what they knew and didn't need to think so much during games
 - He relied on the knowledge that milliseconds count in football, and that if he could build the fastest team with respect to response time, due to habits, they couldn't be beat

## The Golden Rule of Habit Change

 - You can't extinguish a bad habit; you can only change it

 The habit loop is:

 - Cue --> Routine --> Reward

 To change a habit, you retain the cue and reward, and change the routine

 - Cue --> NEW routine --> Reward


## AA Story

 - Bill Wilson essentially lost it all b/c of drink
 - Checked himself into rehab yet again, experienced writhing agony
 - Says to God "If you are there, announce yourself"
 - White light, peace, calm, etc ensues

 Bill Wilson starts AA based on the ideas of habit change, even if he didn't know it at the time

 For alcoholics, stress/anxiety/need for escape is the cue; feeling drunk is the least rewarding part

 Drink is the Routine

 "Oh look, I've escaped my pain" is the reward

 AA replaced the drink routine with a routine of conversation (ala meetings) and talks with a sponsor; the meetings and sponsor provide the ability for the alcoholic to deal with stress and anxiety, to talk... that is their reward

 **Stopping the craving isn't enough**

 In a study, a German neurologist took hardcore alcoholics and put electrical devices in their brain to stop the cravings

 - Even without the cravings, most relapsed

 **To avoid relapse, every single one needed habit change**

 - Once they changed their routine (AA, psychiatry, etc), they stopped drinking altogether


    "As AA's methods have spread, they've been refined into therapies that can be used to disrupt almost any pattern".

## Belief: the Secret Sauce

The cue - new routine - reward cycle is essential for habit change. But it's not enough

Duhigg cites story after story to support the idea that **belief** is critical for **durable** habit changes

Even years after the cue - new routine - reward cycle is established:
 - People fall off the wagon (Alcoholics, eg)
 - People resort to past ingrained behaviors (The Tony Dungy playoff examples)
 - Old routines emerge

Frequently, the trigger is **stress** and anxiety. Example:
 - Sober for years
 - Mom dies
 - Back on the bottle as a way to forget / relieve pain

 Another:

 - football players spend years practicing to make behaviors automatic (Tony Dungy)
 - Playoffs, high-stress, game on the line
 - players start to **think** instead of relying on habits that got them this far

The point here seems to be that when you get all up in your head, that's a trigger for reverting to old routines.

So how to overcome?

**Belief** that change is feasible.

Belief grows out of **communal experience**
 - Belief is easier when it occurs within a community

This is, in fact, the cornerstone of AA meetings and sponsors!

In the Dungy example, it was his son's death that brought his team together.

The teams he coached up till this point, in high pressure games, would **doubt** the effectiveness of Dungy's habit-based approach. They'd revert to thinking, causing them wasted milliseconds (Remember: Dungy's point was that if he could build the fastest-reacting team, no one could beat them).

When they saw how he kept it together after his son's death, they started believing that anything was possible. The team rallied around the coach, but more importantly they rallied themselves.

**Belief helps habits stick**

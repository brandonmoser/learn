# Golden Rule of Habit Change

## Tony Dungy story
 - He transformed the Bucs by making their behaviors on the field automatic
 - He changed their habits such that they relied on what they knew and didn't need to think so much during games
 - He relied on the knowledge that milliseconds count in football, and that if he could build the fastest team with respect to response time, due to habits, they couldn't be beat

## The Golden Rule of Habit Change

 - You can't extinguish a bad habit; you can only change it

 The habit loop is:

 - Cue --> Routine --> Reward

 To change a habit, you retain the cue and reward, and change the routine

 - Cue --> NEW routine --> Reward


## AA Story

 - Bill Wilson essentially lost it all b/c of drink
 - Checked himself into rehab yet again, experienced writhing agony
 - Says to God "If you are there, announce yourself"
 - White light, peace, calm, etc ensues

 Bill Wilson starts AA based on the ideas of habit change, even if he didn't know it at the time

 For alcoholics, stress/anxiety/need for escape is the cue; feeling drunk is the least rewarding part

 Drink is the Routine

 "Oh look, I've escaped my pain" is the reward

 AA replaced the drink routine with a routine of conversation (ala meetings) and talks with a sponsor; the meetings and sponsor provide the ability for the alcoholic to deal with stress and anxiety, to talk... that is their reward

 **Stopping the craving isn't enough**

 In a study, a German neurologist took hardcore alcoholics and put electrical devices in their brain to stop the cravings

 - Even without the cravings, most relapsed

 **To avoid relapse, every single one needed habit change**

 - Once they changed their routine (AA, psychiatry, etc), they stopped drinking altogether


    "As AA's methods have spread, they've been refined into therapies that can be used to disrupt almost any pattern".

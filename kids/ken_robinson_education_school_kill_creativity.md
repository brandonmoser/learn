- "We don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or, rather, we are educated out of it"

- Taught that mistakes are the worst thing

- this carries over into our professional lives as well

- Proper learning requires freedom to experiment and to fail

   - kids aren't afraid to fail, and they're willing to have a go at things
   - you'll never create anything original if you're not willing to be wrong

- I love his description of how education advances... this is after he asks why we don't teach dance every day in school... "after all, we all have bodies"

   - As kids get older, eduacation focuses above the waist, and then only on the head, and then slightly to one side (favors math / logic)

- If you were an alien, you'd conclude that the whole point of public education is to create university professors

- public education came into being to meet the needs of industrialism

- universities designed the public education system in their image

- he talks about how a degree doesn't mean much anymore.... it doesn't guarantee a job, at any rate

- he tells the story of Gillian lynne, famous dancer and choreographer. "She's not sick, she's a dancer. Take her to a dance school"

- "our education system has stripmined our minds in the same way we've stripmined the earth: for a particular commodity"

- Intelligence is not just the mind

- Our task is to educate the whole being

- Reminds me of this, which I read yesterday: http://onsystems.tumblr.com/post/65796540746/on-kelly-and-why-shes-smart-er-than-us

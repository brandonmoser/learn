# The worst conversation you're ever going to have

(He did a previous talk at First Round on meetings and 1:1s... I'd like to find that)


- don't be entrepreneurial about firing someone... ask for help

1. "Your job = your people"

2. You're understimating the cost of not dealing with a problem
  - it's not just you and your problem person
  - it's the entire team. Perhaps they have the same problem with this person that you do
  - This also damages your credibility as a leader
  - People know you're not dealing with the problem
  - Think of my time at BR... this was huge with respect to how we saw "leadership" eventually

3. No surprises

  - What action have you already taken to address this?
  - It should not be a surprise to someone when they get stuck on a "performance plan" or whatever you call it
  - a "plan" is the last ditch effort... there must be stuff before that
  - Fixing it isn't a switch... you should be chipping away at it every day
  - a person should never say "I had no idea this was coming"


- If we were better at giving constructive feedback, we'd avoid a lot of these problems

- If you get to the point of a PIP, try a Pre-PIP first.
  - Don't go down the HR "Please sign this" with the "Or else" clause at the end, not first
  - it's all the work, without the threat
  - Instead, create a well defined list of quanifiable things... written
    - Sure, there will be fuzzier, more subjective things... but keep those to a minimum

4. A PIP should feel like a formality
  - We've done all these other things, now we're getting formal

- The PIP

  - This is a conversation and you're looking for agreement
  - The point is to align on expectations, how to measure it, and the consequences
  - Lopp prefers 3 months:
     - Month 1: micromanaged
     - Month 2: the person gets managed less
     - Month 3: on their own


5. If you have to let someone go, don't fear about the void they leave

   - someone will step up to fill that role

6. Everybody knows, but: assume no one knows

   - You must crush "rumint" (rumor intelligence)
   - talk directly to affected people
   - talk in a group to people who care / are interested

7. Get better

  - If you get to a PIP, you need to figure out how you screwed up to let it get that far

## Thoughts

 - I saw the reputation cost of not dealing with problems first hand, repeatedly, at BR. It had a nightmarish effect on some people
 - I've seen similar in the past 6 months, although the effect was different (not in a good way), more along the lines of simply losing faith / trust, leading to less energy and more hands-tied-what-can-i-do-welcome-to-the-government resignation
 - Lopp's 3-month, 3-phase approach for a PIP makes sense
   - simply writing a plan and throwing the person into the deep end doesn't make sense. It's not realistic to expect fast, flip-switch change. People don't work that way
 - He doesn't talk about it directly, but it's implied: this is why 1:1s are so important... this is probably the simplest way to identify and deal with these problems earlier rather than later
 - For his bit on repeaters offenders, it reminds me of something a former exec said to me once: "You can't rotate a bald tire"
 - Lopp's talk is the end-state, the "what to do when you've already screwed up" talk. To avoid this, I recommend Dale Dauten's "Great Employees Only": http://www.amazon.com/Great-Employees-Only-De-Hire-Success/dp/0470007885
    - Which reminds me... I should reread this
    - Remember how Lopp says that one cost of not addressing a problem is the damage to your credibility as a leader? Here's what Dauten says:

    "A mediocre employee in your group is more than one mediocre employee--he or she is a human multiplier-effect, to the downside. If you have even one mediocre employee, you have announced to the world that mediocrity is okay by you, while conceding that you are willing to slow the entire group for the sake of the worst employee. Thus, allowing that one person to stay is not being kind or generous; it's dangerous. It's dangerous for the individual, who knows that, at some level, he or she is doing second-rate work, and who you are locking into mediocrity, and it is dangerous for the group, which is slowed and distracted."

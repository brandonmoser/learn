Teaching kids to program with Hopscotch

# Idea

 - you don't just sit down and start coding... you need an idea
 - when working with a beginner, you might need to give them ideas to start with
 - at hopscotch, they use sample projects
   - the "truth or dare" story where the kids changed the game to "who farted?"
 - make up their own game (calvinball)
   - calvin creates all the rules for his game
   - then he plays and see what rules work
   - changes rules all the time

# Tools

 - computers are kinda dumb, compared with a human
 - computers do exactly what you tell them, in the order you tell them to do it
 - internalizing that is the first step for beginners... you learn how to be explicit b/c they're so literal
 - then learn computer science primitives, like loops, conditionals
   - "Lists and Loops are BFFs"
   - you probably know this, but you don't think of it that way
   - but beginners need to learn these connections
 - important that people learn how to choose tools, rather than being told exactly what tool to use (i.e. "use a linkedlist to do xyz")
 - Hopscotch does this tool stuff really well, she says
 - Just like tools in the real world, you learn which tools are appropriate in different situations
   - probably not appropriate to use color pencils for a sign for a hockey game

# Algorithm

 - this is how you put yourself into the computer's place and learn to think like a computer
 - in hopscotch, they took ideas from the Logo language
 - cool to see how, given teh same starting idea, different algorithms emerged
 - **Program your parent**
   - let the kid tell you what to do
   - they have to be super explicit, i.e. not just "make a sandwich" but every single step
     - reminds me of Elmo / Mr. Noodle

# Code

 - code is scary, opaque
 - kids especially are very bad, slow typers
 - hopscotch is not scary
   - drag and drop blocks around
   - can't really get error messages
   - don't need to know how to type
   - want to help kids feel successful, "Hey , I could do that"

# Q & A

- Codeia, code lua on your ipad.
  - kinda have to know lua beforehand, and probably need an external keyboard
  - she recommends it as a next step after hopscotch

- one approach they took was to build something ahead of time, and then have the kids try to replicate it... start with the end in mind

- good resources for pedagogy
  - "mind storms" book .. seymour papert
  - bret victor's work
  - hopscotch is in the process of publishing curriculum

- Kris nuttycombe suggests "mice and mystics" board game with kids
  - also, roborally
  - seek cooperative games, where you're playing against a common enemy

I didn't take notes on the first 20 minutes or so... just listened.

# Women's representation in computer occupations

- it's  bleak: declining since 1990s
- women's entry into STEM shows less growth

On science exams, in 65 countries, girls outperformed boys on science tests.... but not the US

The "L'eggo my ego" story is nuts.... women who unlinked themselves (via name) from the test they took outperformed... even if they chose a female name

In another study, as part of the exam they were to reaffirm themselves, and those participants did better than the control group who didn't reaffirm as part of the exam


The study with transgender men... crazy.


Data points to clear stereotypes in our culture with respect to women in STEM.

Must first address the obvious problems, which the data reveal (the Sally Ride "elephant" quote)


Really interesting, powerful story of her time in a CS program and how isolating it was. Talked with a female Carnegie Mellon prof who said "I feel the same way".
Recommended "Unlocking the clubhouse. Women in Computing" (Margolis and Fisher)

# Returning to tech

After she had her daughter, eventually she had to decide whether she wanted to leave tech, or jump back in.
Also decided she didn't want the same educational experience she had the first time around, and so she was going to
have to invent something. Going to have to make a new way for her to interface with the industry

That's when she started Girl Develop It in Columbus. The original was started in NY (I think)

Now, there are 17 chapters, with a waiting list of others


What she learned from GDI

- the numbers in STEM has nothing to do with lack of interest
- women are interested and want to do more
- GDI keen on creating a welcoming environment
  - encourage to ask dumb questions
  - going to support each other; not going to wonder "what, you don't know that already?"

# "The New System"

- says it's hard to talk about this because we're not there yet
- talks about Sally Ride, and the influence she's had on girls. "You can't be what you can't see". Was a strong advocate for science and STEM issues for minorities
- Neil Degrasse Tyson -- always out there advocating for scientific literacy
- Lt. Yuhura (sp?) - Star Trek. Nishelle Nichols was actress
  - was going to leave Star Trek for Broadway
  - meets MLK, who says Star Trek is the only show they let their kids watch
  - She tells MLK she's leaving the show; he says "you can't do that"
  - She didn't realize how important it was that she was on there, the message it was sending, how important that visibility was
  - After Star Trek, she spent 18 years working as a recruiter for NASA. Brought NASA a whole pool of diverse people
    - first A.A. astronaut; more women than ever before



# Takeaways

 - as a father: be alert in my daughters for the isolation that Jen describes
 - be sure to never put out the impression that "you should know this, why don't you?"
 - makes me think of my 10yo daughter's math opinion: "I hate math. I'm not good at it. I don't know why it's important", even though she's actually really good at it
   - what do I do about this? Simply continue to encourage? dig deeper? Talk to her teacher?
   - I wonder if she needs to hear these things from someone other than her parents
   - Maybe Jen can call her and remind her how awesome she can be :-)
 - Being really smart in one area doesn't give you a free pass to not grow in others
   - growing as human beings is important!
   - the "Social Network" Zuckerberg story
   - For me, this is one of those super obvious things that bears constant repeating, and I love how Jen phrased it
 - The idea that going out and getting facts -- learning -- is inspired by romance (think Lord Byron, not Fabio) and a love of life, excitement for life
 - Work to elevate other people.
   - yes, we care about our system and our product
   - But instead of saying "you aren't at my level", say "let's see if we can elevate you"
   - create heroines and heros that we can look up to. Give people a reason to want to join our field
   - challenge yourself to grow in other areas and learn as much as we can
     - look into our biases, identify the things holding us back
     - find things that "are the way they are" and question them
   - This goes back to that thing I used to say: "I exult in your success"
 - I wonder if Jen knows that  people like me in the audience -- white dudes -- sometimes (often?) feel the kind of impostor syndrome that she describes (but didn't name). While I certainly can't live her experience, I absolutely can identify with the self-doubt, the negative "am I good enough for this industry" self-talk. The thing is, for me, intellectually it makes no sense. It's like wondering about yourself, "what the hell happened to you when you were a kid?". But the thoughts/emotions are real..
